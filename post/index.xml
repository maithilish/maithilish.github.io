      <description>For long, I was looking for an ideal backup setup. Expectations were minimal;periodically backup set of folders from the main disk to secondary disk, compressing the files to save disk space, retaining the earlier sets and easy to learn, deploy and maintain. I tried and dropped many backup solutions because of cumbersome setup and steep learning curve.
Finally, I chose Borg Backup for its sophistication and ease of use; thereupon, using it for more than a year now.</description>

      <description>The previous post, Borg Backup, explained installation and basics of Borg, and this post introduces Pybs, a simple python script to automate backups in Linux systems. To automate the backups, Pybs uses Python, YAML, Borg and Systemd. For non-linux platforms use some other task scheduler in place of Systemd.
Installation Download Pybs from Github and extract it in your home dir.
Pybs, by default, uses Borg repository at $HOME/backup/borgrepo located in user home directory, and for sake of explanation, we stick with it.</description>
