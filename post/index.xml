      <description>For long, I was looking for an ideal backup setup. Expectations were minimal;periodically backup set of folders from the main disk to secondary disk, compressing the files to save disk space, retaining the earlier sets and easy to learn, deploy and maintain. I tried and dropped many backup solutions because of cumbersome setup and steep learning curve.
Finally, I chose Borg Backup for its sophistication and ease of use; thereupon, using it for more than a year now.</description>

      <description>The previous post, Borg Backup, explained installation and basics of Borg, and this post introduces Pybs, a simple python script to automate backups in Linux systems. To automate the backups, Pybs uses Python, YAML, Borg and Systemd. For non-linux platforms use some other task scheduler in place of Systemd.
Installation Download Pybs from Github and extract it in your home dir.
Pybs, by default, uses Borg repository at $HOME/backup/borgrepo located in user home directory, and for sake of explanation, we stick with it.</description>

      <description>Fun with Unicode in Java Normally we don&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention to character encoding in Java. However, when we crisscross byte and char streams, things can get confusing unless we know the charset basics. Many tutorials and posts about character encoding are heavy in theory with little real examples. In this post, we try to demystify Unicode with easy to grasp examples.
Encode and Decode Before diving into Unicode, first let&amp;rsquo;s understand terms - encode and decode.</description>

      <description>Hugo Webfont The share icons rendered above are not images, instead they are font icons. Font icons, also called webfont, are scalable vector icons that can be controlled with CSS; the size, color, shadow, etc.
Font Awesome is extensively used webfont, with more than 650 icons. The downside is that the size of Font Awesome is around 130kb and we end up downloading many unused icons. To reduce the size and speedup page loading time, we can pick and choose few icons and create a custom pack; codetab.</description>
