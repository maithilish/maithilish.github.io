Somewhere around 2010 I bought the book; by that time, the example code used in the book for the Eclipse 2 platform was already outdated. How much ever I tried, I could not fix and run the code in Eclipse Platform 3. Without the running plugin, soon I gave up and put away the book.</description></item></channel></rss>
