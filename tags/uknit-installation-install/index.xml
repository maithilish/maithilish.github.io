uKnit is also distributed as release zip which contains uKnit core and a Quickstart example project. The uKnit core is a Maven project which needs to be in your IDE workspace along with the project for which you wish to generate unit tests. Install uKnit only if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to add uKnit dependency to your project&amp;rsquo;s pom for some reason.</description></item></channel></rss>
