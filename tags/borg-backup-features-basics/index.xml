Expectations were minimal,
periodically backup a set of folders from the main disk to fallback disk. compress backup to save space. retain the earlier backup sets. easy to learn, deploy and maintain. I tried and dropped many backup solutions because of cumbersome setup and steep learning curve. Finally, I chose Borg Backup and using it for more than a year now; happy with its ease of use and trouble free backups.</description></item></channel></rss>
